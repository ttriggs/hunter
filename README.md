## Gear Hunter
Using the Reverb.com API to personalize your gear hunting.

### Goals
- [ ] The first goal of this project is to search Reverb.com for effects pedals
      that match search criteria saved in the app.
- [ ] Display/track the top (10?) search results price sorted low to high with links to the listing.
- [ ] Be able to 'archive' listings you have already checked or would like to dismiss
- [ ] Use a customized heuristic for determining which listings are worth viewing for potential pruchase.

#### Possible Heuristics
  - [ ] Frequency of recent sales
  - [ ] Listing is near historic selling minimum
  - [ ] Little competition in market (gap in cost between it and next cheapest listing)
