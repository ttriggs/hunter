- [x] Display the top (15?) search results total price sorted low to high with links to the listing.
- [ ] Store/Track saved search listing results
- [ ] Use a customized heuristic for determining which listings are worth viewing for potential pruchase
- [ ] Be able to 'archive' listings you have already checked or would like to dismiss
